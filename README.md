User Stories:
A user should be able to navigate to "/" and see a basic splash page with:
The name of the website.
Links to "Log In" and "Sign Up" and
Sign up for an account.

A user should be able to log into their account if they already have one.
Be redirected to their public profile page after logging in.
On their public profile page, see their name, and their join date.
See the site-wide header on every page with:
A link to "Log Out" if they're logged in.
Links to "Log In" and "Sign Up" if they're logged out.
Update their profile by making changes to their name.

An admin user should be able to add a review to the site through the admin panel.

Unsolved Problems/major hurdles:
-Extending django's built in user model and all it offers to keep the code DRY.
Learning how to use it prevented building out a full profile model & kept the model file DRY.

-Enabling an email feature that accepts all emails, settled on gmail in the end.
- Using UploadCare for the profile and product images. The 3rd party storage is a great resource for keeping memory DRY.
